# System Prerequisites for MQTT Image Capture and Receiver

1. **Python 3.x**
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Python 3.6 or later is recommended.
   - Download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **pip (Python Package Installer)**
   - `pip` should be included with Python 3.x. Verify installation with:
     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```
   - If `pip` is not installed, follow the installation instructions at the [pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

3. **fswebcam**
   - `fswebcam` is used to capture images from a webcam.
   - On Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu), install `fswebcam` with:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install fswebcam
     ```
   - For other operating systems, consult the [fswebcam documentation](https://github.com/fsphil/fswebcam) for installation instructions.

4. **MQTT Broker Access**
   - The scripts use the MQTT broker at `broker.hivemq.com`. Ensure you have access to this broker or modify the script to use a different broker if necessary.

5. **Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   - It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies.
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv myenv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source myenv/bin/activate
       ```
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       myenv\Scripts\activate
       ```

6. **Install Python Dependencies**
   - After setting up the virtual environment, install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

7. **Check Your MQTT Broker Configuration**
   - Ensure that your MQTT broker configuration in the scripts (`broker = 'broker.hivemq.com'` and `topic = 'image'`) matches your setup. Adjust these settings as needed based on your MQTT broker.

By following these prerequisites, you will prepare your system to run the MQTT image capture and receiver scripts effectively.
